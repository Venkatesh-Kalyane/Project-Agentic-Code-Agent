# Simple Calculator

A lightweight, browser‑based calculator built with plain HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. It implements the full set of basic arithmetic operations, including square root, exponentiation and percentage conversion. No build step or tooling is required – just open the page in a browser.

---

## 📦 Features

- **Digits & Decimal** – Enter numbers using the keypad or keyboard.
- **Basic arithmetic** – `+`, `-`, `×`, `÷` (plus keyboard equivalents `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- **Advanced operations** – Square root (`√`), exponentiation (`^`), percentage (`%`).
- **Clear & Backspace** – `C` clears the entire input; `←` removes the last character.
- **Equals** – `=` or `Enter` evaluates the expression.
- **Keyboard support** – All operations are available via the keyboard.
- **Responsive design** – Works on desktop and mobile browsers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Semantic markup for the calculator layout.
- **CSS3** – Simple, clean styling and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – All logic is encapsulated in a small `Calculator` class.

No external libraries or build tools are required.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Download or clone** the repository.
2. **Open** `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.).
3. Start using the calculator immediately – no installation or build steps needed.

> **Tip:** If you prefer a local development server (e.g., for hot‑reload or testing on mobile), you can use a simple tool like `live-server` or any static file server.
